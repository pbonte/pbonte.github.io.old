 abstract = {The increase of ICT infrastructure in hospitals offer opportunities for cost reduction by optimizing workflows, while maintaining quality of care. This work-in-progress poster details the AORTA system, which is a semantic platform to optimize transportation task scheduling and execution in hospitals. It provides a dynamic scheduler with an upto-date view about the current context by performing semantic reasoning on the information provided by the available software tools and smart devices. Additionally, it learns semantic rules based on historical data in order to avoid future delays in transportation time.},
