The platform implements a modular, data-driven workflow that allows developers of interaction services to determine the appropriate time, content and style of human-robot interaction tasks by reasoning on semantically enriched loT sensor data. The platform also abstracts the complexities of scheduling, planning and execution of these tasks, and can automatically adjust parameters to the personal profile and current context.

By combining this generated data with background knowledge and performing expressive reasoning upon this combination, meaningful decisions can be made. Furthermore, this continuously generated data typically originates from multiple heterogeneous sources. Ontologies are ideal for modeling the domain and facilitates the integration of heterogeneous produced data with background knowledge. Furthermore, expressive ontology reasoning allows to infer implicit facts and enables intelligent decision making. The data produced in these domains is often volatile. Time-critical systems, such as IoT Nurse Call systems, require timely processing of the produced IoT data. However, there is still a mismatch between volatile data and expressive ontology reasoning, since the incoming data frequency is often higher than the reasoning time. For this reason, we present an approximation technique that allows to extract a subset of data to speed-up the reasoning process. We demonstrate this technique in a Nurse Call proof of concept where the locations of the nurses are tracked and the most suited nurse is selected when the patient launches a call and in an extension of an existing benchmark. We managed to speed up the reasoning process up to 10 times for small datasets and up to more than 1000 times for large datasets.","tags":["\"ONTOLOGY\"","\"STREAMS\"","\"Reasoning\"","\"streams\"","\"event-based\"","\"ontology\"","\"nurse call\""],"title":"Subset reasoning for event-based systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pieter Bonte","Femke Ongenae","Filip De Turck"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608631011,"objectID":"d8a549ff12fcbe04c11d8951c9f55a0d","permalink":"http://pbonte.github.io/web/publication/8623325/","publishdate":"2020-12-22T09:56:51.626768Z","relpermalink":"/web/publication/8623325/","section":"publication","summary":"The continuous financial pressure on hospitals forces them to rethink various workflows. We focus on optimizing hospital transports, within the hospital, as they count up to 30% of the overall hospital cost.

We pay special attention to the explainability of the self-learning system, such that management understands the learned causes and remains in control over the automated process. This is achieved by providing the learned causes as sentences that can be understood by non-technical personnel and allowing these causes to first be supervised before the system takes them into account. Once approved, the system will calculate how much more time should be assigned to these transports in order to avoid future delays. As a result, the scheduling of patient transportation can be automatically optimized, while management remains in full control of the process.","tags":["\"DYNAMIC TRANSPORTATION\"","\"ONTOLOGIES\"","\"HEALTH\"","\"Rule learning\"","\"ontology\"","\"hospital transport\""],"title":"Towards optimizing hospital patient transports by automatically identifying interpretable causes of delays","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Riccardo Tommasini","Pieter Bonte","Emanuele Della Valle","Femke Ongenae","Filip De Turck"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608631012,"objectID":"d2119d8ce50dcddb0cd77a4d3487d07d","permalink":"http://pbonte.github.io/web/publication/8581984/","publishdate":"2020-12-22T09:56:52.656167Z","relpermalink":"/web/publication/8581984/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"A query model for ontology-based event processing over RDF streams","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pieter Bonte","Filip De Turck","Femke Ongenae"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608631012,"objectID":"faeff7cf6bab9d91d3993499a845fdda","permalink":"http://pbonte.github.io/web/publication/8577848/","publishdate":"2020-12-22T09:56:52.2384Z","relpermalink":"/web/publication/8577848/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Context-aware patient monitoring through sensor streams","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dörthe Arndt","Pieter Bonte","Alexander Dejonghe","Ruben Verborgh","Filip De Turck","Femke Ongenae"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608631012,"objectID":"e23d4000a4275d59d5b793fba03ec1aa","permalink":"http://pbonte.github.io/web/publication/8552458/","publishdate":"2020-12-22T09:56:52.514222Z","relpermalink":"/web/publication/8552458/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"IBCN\""],"title":"SENSdesc : connect sensor queries and context","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Femke De Backere","Pieter Bonte","Stijn Verstichel","Femke Ongenae","Filip De Turck"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608631012,"objectID":"37ad0ec4f641e066d59dea2fb8ecf77c","permalink":"http://pbonte.github.io/web/publication/8550825/","publishdate":"2020-12-22T09:56:52.819266Z","relpermalink":"/web/publication/8550825/","section":"publication","summary":"In 2013, the Flemish Government launched the Vitalink platform.

Through a case study, the possibility of interaction with cloud solutions for healthcare is also investigated upon; this was initially not the focus of Vitalink. The Vitalink initiative provides support for secure data sharing in primary healthcare, which in the long term will improve the efficiency of care and will decrease costs. Based on the results of the case study, Vitalink allowed cloud solutions or applications not providing end-to-end security to use their system.

To perform meaningful analysis over multiple of these streams, stream processing needs to support expressive reasoning capabilities to infer implicit facts and temporal reasoning to capture temporal dependencies. However, current approaches cannot perform the required reasoning expressivity while detecting time dependencies over high frequency data streams. There is still a mismatch between the complexity of processing and the rate data is produced in volatile domains. Therefore, we introduce Streaming MASSIF, a Cascading Reasoning approach performing expressive reasoning and complex event processing over high velocity streams. Cascading Reasoning is a vision that solves the problem of expressive reasoning over high frequency streams by introducing a hierarchical approach consisting of multiple layers. Each layer minimizes the processed data and increases the complexity of the data processing. Cascading Reasoning is a vision that has not been fully realized. Streaming MASSIF is a layered approach allowing IoT service to subscribe to high-level and temporal dependent concepts in volatile data streams. We show that Streaming MASSIF is able to handle high velocity streams up to hundreds of events per second, in combination with expressive reasoning and complex event processing. Streaming MASSIF realizes the Cascading Reasoning vision and is able to combine high expressive reasoning with high throughput of processing. Furthermore, we formalize semantically how the different layers in our Cascading Reasoning Approach collaborate.","tags":[],"title":"Streaming MASSIF : cascading reasoning for efficient processing of iot data streams","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mathias De Brouwer","Femke Ongenae","Pieter Bonte","Filip De Turck"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608631013,"objectID":"674ee2ec40efa657f8d25ee35f606591","permalink":"http://pbonte.github.io/web/publication/8581923/","publishdate":"2020-12-22T09:56:52.966865Z","relpermalink":"/web/publication/8581923/","section":"publication","summary":"In hospitals and smart nursing homes, ambient-intelligent care rooms are equipped with many sensors. They can monitor environmental and body parameters, and detect wearable devices of patients and nurses. Hence, they continuously produce data streams. This offers the opportunity to collect, integrate and interpret this data in a context-aware manner, with a focus on reactivity and autonomy. However, doing this in real time on huge data streams is a challenging task. In this context, cascading reasoning is an emerging research approach that exploits the trade-off between reasoning complexity and data velocity by constructing a processing hierarchy of reasoners. Therefore, a cascading reasoning framework is proposed in this paper. A generic architecture is presented allowing to create a pipeline of reasoning components hosted locally, in the edge of the network, and in the cloud. The architecture is implemented on a pervasive health use case, where medically diagnosed patients are constantly monitored, and alarming situations can be detected and reacted upon in a context-aware manner. A performance evaluation shows that the total system latency is mostly lower than 5 s, allowing for responsive intervention by a nurse in alarming situations. Using the evaluation results, the benefits of cascading reasoning for healthcare are analyzed.","tags":["\"ONTOLOGY\"","\"MANAGEMENT\"","\"STREAMS\"","\"SPARQL\"","\"pervasive healthcare\"","\"cascading reasoning\"","\"stream reasoning\""],"title":"Towards a cascading reasoning framework to support responsive ambient-intelligent healthcare interventions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pieter Bonte","Femke Ongenae","Jeroen Schaballie","W.

Applications can have a notion of context awareness by combining this sensed data, or by processing the combined data. The processes of combining data can consist both of merging the dynamic sensed data, as well as fusing the sensed data with background and historical data. Semantics can aid in this task, as they have proven their use in data integration, knowledge exchange and reasoning. Semantic services performing reasoning on the integrated sensed data, combined with background knowledge, such as profile data, allow extracting useful information and support intelligent decision making. However, advanced reasoning on the combination of this sensed data and background knowledge is still hard to achieve. Furthermore, the collaboration between semantic services allows to reach complex decisions. The dynamic composition of such collaborative workflows that can adapt to the current context, has not received much attention yet. In this paper, we present MASSIF, a data-driven platform for the semantic annotation of and reasoning on IoT data. It allows the integration of multiple modular reasoning services that can collaborate in a flexible manner to facilitate complex decision-making processes. Data-driven workflows are enabled by letting services specify the data they would like to consume. After thorough processing, these services can decide to share their decisions with other consumers. By defining the data these services would like to consume, they can operate on a subset of data, improving reasoning efficiency. Furthermore, each of these services can integrate the consumed data with background knowledge in its own context model, for rapid intelligent decision making.

With the rise of pervasive healthcare, new information technology solutions can assist elderly people (\\\"residents\\\") and their caregivers to allow residents to live independently for as long as possible. Methods: To this end, the OCarePlatform system was designed. This semantic, data-driven and cloud based back-end system facilitates independent living by offering information and knowledge-based services to the resident and his/her (in)formal caregivers. Data and context information are gathered to realize context-aware and personalized services and to support residents in meeting their daily needs. This body of data, originating from heterogeneous data and information sources, is sent to personalized services, where is fused, thus creating an overview of the resident's current situation. Results: The architecture of the OCarePlatform is proposed, which is based on a service-oriented approach, together with its different components and their interactions. The implementation details are presented, together with a running example. A scalability and performance study of the OCarePlatform was performed. The results indicate that the OCarePlatform is able to support a realistic working environment and respond to a trigger in less than 5 seconds. The system is highly dependent on the allocated memory. Conclusion: The data-driven character of the OCarePlatform facilitates easy plug-in of new functionality, enabling the design of personalized, context-aware services. The OCarePlatform leads to better support for elderly people and individuals with chronic illnesses, who live independently. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

An alternative is to use a rule-based reasoner together with the OWL RL/RDF rules as stated in the specification of the OWL 2 language profiles. In most cases this approach actually improves reasoning times, but due to the complexity of the rules, not as much as it could. In this paper we present an improved strategy: based on the TBoxes of the ontologies involved in a reasoning task, we create more specific rules which then can be used for further reasoning. We make use of the EYE reasoner and its logic Notation3. In this logic, rules can be employed to derive new rules which makes the rule creation a reasoning step on its own. We evaluate our implementation on a semantic nurse call system. Our results show that adding a pre-reasoning step to produce specialized rules improves reasoning times by around 75 %.","tags":["\"IBCN\"","\"Notation3\"","\"Rule-based reasoning\"","\"OWL 2 RL\""],"title":"Improving OWL RL reasoning in N3 by using specialized rules","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pieter Bonte","Femke Ongenae","Filip De Turck"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608631014,"objectID":"45b55bd66b20fd263cb32273982df4f0","permalink":"http://pbonte.github.io/web/publication/8505900/","publishdate":"2020-12-22T09:56:53.849735Z","relpermalink":"/web/publication/8505900/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"IBCN\""],"title":"Learning semantic rules for intelligent transport scheduling in hospitals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pieter Bonte","Femke Ongenae","Eveline Hoogstoel","Filip De Turck"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608631014,"objectID":"27ce34924aeb725cdc901d1db8002f05","permalink":"http://pbonte.github.io/web/publication/8506052/","publishdate":"2020-12-22T09:56:54.253089Z","relpermalink":"/web/publication/8506052/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["\"IBCN\""],"title":"Mining semantic rules for optimizing transport assignments in hospitals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Femke Ongenae","Pieter Bonte","Jeroen Schaballie","Bert Vankeirsbilck","Filip De Turck"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608631014,"objectID":"483dad3dc617ffa8c8a0c27f09bad257","permalink":"http://pbonte.github.io/web/publication/8500134/","publishdate":"2020-12-22T09:56:54.59393Z","relpermalink":"/web/publication/8500134/","section":"publication","summary":"The increase of ICT infrastructure in hospitals offer opportunities for cost reduction by optimizing workflows, while maintaining quality of care.

Which specific nurse is called cannot be controlled, as there is no extra information available. This is different for solutions based on semantic knowledge: if the state of care givers (busy or free), their current position, and for example their skills are known, a system can always choose the best suitable nurse for a call. In this paper we describe such a semantic nurse call system implemented using the EYE reasoner and Notation3 rules. The system is able to perform OWL-RL reasoning. Additionally, we use rules to implement complex decision trees. We compare our solution to an implementation using OWL-DL, the Pellet reasoner, and SPARQL queries. We show that our purely rule-based approach gives promising results.

Crucially, it remains unclear just who is to be considered a 'potential parent', how soon they should take up preconception responsibilities, and how weighty their responsibilities should be. Discussion: In this paper, we argue that a normal potential parent of reasonable prudence has a moral duty to adequately optimize the conditions under which she or his reproductive partner will conceive, though a proportionality calculus calls for toleration of several forms of preconception behaviour that are non-ideal from the perspective of reproductive risk. We distinguish between five categories of potential parents to which different duties of preconception care should be ascribed. This framework is advanced to assign preconception care responsibilities with more precision than is often done in the current debate on preconception care. We conclude by applying our theoretical framework to three types of preconception care interventions: consumption of folic acid; keeping one's weight under control; and engaging in preconception genetic screening. Our analysis shows that the literature on preconception care often glosses over crucial distinctions between different types of potential parents and uses a notion of preconception beneficence that may be overly demanding. Nevertheless, preconception moral duties will often be weighty and reluctance to accept such duties on account of the burden they impose do not warrant preconception insouciance. Summary: To avoid misplaced responsibility ascriptions in the growing field of preconception care, distinctions must be made between different types of potential parents to whom different degrees of preconception responsibility apply. We present such a preliminary framework and bring it to bear on the cases of folic acid consumption, obesity and genetic testing.","tags":["\"LIFE\"","\"ASSISTED REPRODUCTION\"","\"Preconception care\"","\"Beneficence\"","\"Folic acid\"","\"Obesity\"","\"Genetic testing\""],"title":"Is there a moral obligation to conceive children under the best possible conditions?
